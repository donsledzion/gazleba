Simple register of consuption and costs of gas fuel usage in my workplace.

I've made it at work while working as a clerk at Łeba's City Hall.

Service can store and display only sorted data taken from bills recived by Łeba's City Hall.
The data provided by service is public.

working website at:

Administrator's credencials provide possibility of submitting new data.

There was plans to upgrade service with multiple functionalities such as presenting various data summaries but...
...there was not enough time at work.
